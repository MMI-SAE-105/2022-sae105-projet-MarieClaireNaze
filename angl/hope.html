        <h2 class="main__soustitre">A turbulent past</h2>
        <article class="main__article">
        <p>In the 2000s we were at a turning point in history. The previous century was marked by world wars, death, hatred, disease and conflict. As a result, the past left a strange legacy for our generation: we were living in a planet that was dying because of pollution from previous industrial revolutions, nuclear bombs and our over-consumption of resources.</p>
        <p>This world was full of global conflicts, racism, discrimination, fear and hatred, no one listened anymore, everyone shouted their ideas louder than the one next to them, such a world subject to the codes of the past did not fit us anymore.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century has seen the birth of many technologies such as the internet and social networks, and we have learned to know others as they are: human beings like us.</p>
        <p>However, many of the past generations who had left their impact were trying to divide us and continue this hatred.</p>

        <em><h2 class="main__citation">"Man is naturally good, it is society that corrupts him".</h2></em>
        <article class="main__article">
            <p> Rousseau said "Man is naturally good, it is society that corrupts him", many of us believed that this was always the case, that we could change things, that we could have a society in our image.</p>
            <p>In this world, the earth would not be dying, there would be no unnecessary conflicts and everyone would be able to live their lives as they chose without pressure from society.</p>
            <p>This was a very utopian vision at the time and it took a long time to get to the world where you live dear travellers.</p>
