        <p>The future has always fascinated, interested and scared people especially during my time when so many events were happening. We feel that our future, your present, dear traveler, will be radically different from what we knew.

                <p>Foundation is the first volume of the "Foundation Cycle" saga written by Isaac Asimov, a Russian-American author of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>This 7-volume saga is set in 22,000 years after our era.</p>
                <p>Humanity has established an intergalactic empire of 25 million planets.</p>
                <p>However, after more than 10,000 years of rule, a mathematician named Hari Sheldon develops a new science called psychohistory and predicts the fall of the Empire, and of humanity, in a few hundred years.</p>
                <p>To ensure the survival of Man and his knowledge, a group of men and women are sent to a planet called Terminus to protect and pass on the knowledge of mankind in one great work: The Encyclopedia.</p>

            <article class="main__article">
                <p>The whole concept of this story is based on psychohistory. A science invented by Hari Seldon which, thanks to extremely precise mathematical calculations, makes it possible to predict the future with great details, although the degree of this accuracy can vary because of the "human variant", in fact it is difficult to predict what a human being is capable of</p>
                <p>The encyclopaedists* attach great importance to it to the point of considering it as something infallible or even prophetic.

            </h2>
            <article class="main__article">
                <p>Now, we are going to analyze an extract from chapter 12 (line… at…). It’s a dialogue between two characters: Hardin, the mayor of Terminus and Sieur Dorwin, come to represent the Emperor following political tensions between several planets. Together, the two men will talk about human origin and will question each other thanks to the work of a researcher, on the identity of the planet where their ancestors were born.</p>
                <p>The two men will then put forward two different visions of research : one swears by the writings of his predecessors and will find it useless and senseless to go on expeditions for more research, while the other prefers to believe it.</p>
                <p class="main__conclusion">NB: Lord Dorwin Coming from a particular caste has a way of speaking that he is as well, he does not take the 'r's which is why in this extract all the 's in the middle of words mean 'r'.</p>

                  <h2 class="main__soustitre">The Origin Matter: The Schrodinger's Cat Experiment</h2>
                  <p class="main__article"> We can compare this debate to the Schrodinger's cat exercise: we put a cat in a box with poison without opening the box, we cannot know if the fish killed the cat or if it is still alive, we then consider that the cat is both dead and alive. It is the same thing here, we suppose that the cradle of humanity is around the star Sirius, or Arcturus or even around the Sun, but nobody can or wants to go and experience it, so under these conditions the question of the origin of humanity remains, like the cat, both known and unknown. </p>
                  <p class="main__article">Which is ironic knowing that the survival of mankind is done thanks to the encyclopedia which traces the history and knowledge of mankind.</p>
