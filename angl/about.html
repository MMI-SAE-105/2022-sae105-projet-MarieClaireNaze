      <h2 class="main__soustitre">Who I am ?</h2>
      <p class="main__article">My name is Marie-Claire and i’m the creator of Time Loop.</p>

      <h2 class="main__soustitre">Time Loop, What is it?</h2>
      <p class="main__article">Time Loop is a school project based on the theme "Note for later" inspired by the song of the famous French rapper Orelsan "Note for too late".</p>
      <p class="main__article">So it was from 0 that I started this project, I had a lot of ideas at first but they were still quite vague. The big ideas that came up were fantasy, dreams and time and after some thought it seemed more appropriate to deal with the latter.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="main__soustitre">Genesis of the project:  MaNa</h2>
      <p class="main__article">Based on the concept of the time capsule I decided to create MaNa, my letter to the future, and its history. It represents my digitalized consciousness on the internet that will introduce my generation to future generations. Its name is inspired by mine (with the beginning of my name and my first name) but also by the name of the magical force in one of my favourite video games: The Kingdom Of Amalur Reckoning. It's not a coincidence because it reminds the mystic side that the concept of MaNa can have.</p>
      <p class="main__article">MaNa is an endearing character whose purpose is to serve as a breadcrumb trail for the readers, his personality is directly inspired by the character of Paimon from Genshin Impact. So the Time Loop project represents me completely by using all the things that inspire and motivate me.
